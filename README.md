# FreaksTimer

Do you like to build your own promodoro timer ? ElecFreaks has built a great programmable Arduino (Leonardo compatible w/ ATmega32U4) device sold here: [FreaksTimer](http://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/freakstimer.html), and we at MakeHub Taiwan tries to make it better by rewriting the firmware sketches.

- sketch_dec07a -- This is the original firmware sketch comes with the device. You must compile it with the specific r11 version of TimerOne library. (could be downloaded here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino-timerone/downloads)

- PromodoroTimer -- MakeHub completely rewrote the whole firwmare sketch with better coding technique. Now it's shorter and clear for further improvements. Perfect to work as a pomodoro timer used with [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com)
